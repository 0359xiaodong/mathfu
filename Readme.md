MathFu Version [1.0.0][]

# Welcome to MathFu!

MathFu is a math library for games.  Go to our
[landing page][] to browse our documentation and see some examples.

MathFu serves as a generalized library that developers can download for use in
their Android applications. However, the library does supports any os (Android,
iOS, Linux, Mac OS, Windows) and is optimized for both arm (Android/iOS) and x86
(Linux, Mac OS, Windows) hardware. It implements vector, matrix, and quaternion
each with basic math operations including *, +, -, /, DotProduct, CrossProduct,
Inverse, and Slerp.

Discuss MathFu with other developers and users on the
[MathFu Google Group][].  File issues on the [MathFu Issues Tracker][]
or post your questions to [stackoverflow.com][] with a mention of
**mathfu**.

Please see `Documentation` to learn how to use MathFu and
run the tests.

For applications on Google Play that integrate this tool, usage is tracked.
This tracking is done automatically using the embedded version string
(kMathFuFunVersionString), and helps us continue to optimize it. Aside from
consuming a few extra bytes in your application binary, it shouldn't affect
your application at all. We use this information to let us know if MathFu
is useful and if we should continue to invest in it. Since this is open
source, you are free to remove the version string but we would appreciate if
you would leave it in.
